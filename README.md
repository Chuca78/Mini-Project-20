# React Portfolio

## Description

This application is a portfolio created using my React skills. It is deployed to GitHub Pages. This portfolio was designed for potential employers looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications. It will show potential employers a deployed React portfolio of work samples and projects. I have also built a contact form if potential employers want to ask any questions or offer me a job. Lastly, I have built a summarized resume page and a link to my full resume.
